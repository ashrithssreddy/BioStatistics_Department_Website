<h2>Master of Science in Biostatistics</h2>

<b> Dummy text:</b> All of the MS degrees provide a route to a career in statistics. Prospective students should note that the MS in statistics, mathematical statistics track and MS in biostatistics degrees provide the best preparation for continuation into the doctoral programs (PhD in statistics or biostatistics) in this department. A student who finishes the applied statistics program can continue into a PhD program upon completion of the core courses for the MS in mathematical statistics or the MS in biostatistics (as given in Tables 4 and 8) and passing the PhD qualifying exams.
